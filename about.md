  Progress in AI research and innovation can provide tools to help tackle the
  complex challenges society faces – in economic growth, health and social care,
  environment and wellbeing, and more. To deliver on this promise, AI research
  and development needs to connect to public interests, concerns, and areas of
  need. ai@cam is building an infrastructure for interdisciplinary AI innovation
  through research, education, and innovation programmes that leverage the
  world-leading research already taking place across the University and
  connecting this to real-world needs. Read more about our work in our 2023-24
  annual report at this link.
